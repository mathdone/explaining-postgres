# Explaining PostgreSQL
This is a collection of articles with some of the stuff I had to learn about postgresql the hard way. I'll start with a complete guide for reading execution plans and I might add some stuff about indexes and configurations if I find the time. Hope this proves useful to someone. Feel free to point mistakes and add suggestions in the issues.
